# CountryCapitals
A plugin to allow players to teleport to the capitals of countries in the 1:2000 scale earth map from here: https://earth.motfe.net/2019/01/02/downloads/  


Permission nodes:
country.use  
country.bypasscooldown  
country.bypassdelay  

country.use - Allows you to use the /country command  
country.bypasscooldown - Allows you to bypass the cooldown on the /country command  
country.bypassdelay - Allows you to bypass the delay on the /country command  

Commands:  

/country - Aliases: /capital, /c  

To get all the minecraft coordinates, I used the script in the PositionToYaml folder and generated a yaml file with the correct format for the plugin.  

To get all the normal coordinates, I used this site: http://www.csgnetwork.com/llinfotable.html. I also used this site: https://coordinates-converter.com/en/decimal/51.000000,10.000000?karte=OpenStreetMap&zoom=8 to fill in missing locations, and I used my own Country Capitals Game to get the information on each country and capitals.
